# 🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository contains my **daily Python problem-solving practice**, starting from basics and gradually moving toward advanced logic.

I use this repo to:
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Practice writing clean and readable code
- Track my daily consistency
  
Each folder represents **one day of practice** with multiple problems solved manually before using any built-in shortcuts.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a **strong foundation in Python** and progress from beginner to advanced problem-solving, one day at a time.
